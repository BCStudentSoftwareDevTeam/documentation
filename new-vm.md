## Using your new virtual machine

A **virtual machine**, or VM, is an emulation of a computer system. Many different virtual machines can be hosted on one piece of computer hardware, but they each appear as their own individual computer system.

You will use an **IP address** to access this system, or, hopefully soon, a **hostname**. The IP address is a set of 4 numbers that uniquely identifies the computer on the network, and the hostname is the human-readable name of the computer.

These VMs run Ubuntu, a Linux distribution. Linux is the operating system that runs most of the worldwide web, as well as all Android phones, and many other types of computers. To learn more about using Linux, [click here|/linux]
