# Chemical Users
Chemical users can be faculty, staff, or students. There are only a small list of users who have access to the chemical application. Permissions are set in the application.

## Importing Users

Users are added and updated manually.

 ## User Permissions
 
Users can be Master Administrator, Super User (Faculty & Staff), System Administrator (Student EHS Workers), and System User (Students). These permissions can be adjusted on the User Management page: https://chemical.berea.edu/Home/#user.
