# CSC186 Setup

We were unable to get IS&S to pass web traffic through to the websites on our VMs, so we had to come up with a workaround.

Originally the sites were developed on internal VMs (IPs below), using SFTP and the `webuser` user to update the `www/` directory.

Each site has a private repository on github in the `bereacs` organization. This repository is set up as an AWS Amplify app in the us-east-1 region that automatically deploys when the repository changes.

There is a screen session on each VM running an inotify command to monitor `www/` for changes. The command will automatically commit additions, updates, and deletions to git and push to the githhub repo.
`inotifywait -q -m -e delete -e CLOSE_WRITE --format="git add %w && git commit -m 'auto commit' && git push origin master" . | bash`
