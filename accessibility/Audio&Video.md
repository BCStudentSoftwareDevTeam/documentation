# Audio & Video Checklist
## Beginner
**[Guideline 1.2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?currentsidebar=%23col_overview&showtechniques=222#audio-only-and-video-only-prerecorded)**: Any pre-recorded audio-only content should have an alternative that gives equivalent information.
> Example: Myspace used to have the option to add music (audio-only content) to your webpage. They also gave the title of the song and the artist as an alternative with equivalent information.

**[Guideline 1.2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?currentsidebar=%23col_overview&showtechniques=222#audio-only-and-video-only-prerecorded)**: Any pre-recorded video-only content should have an alternative that gives equivalent information.
> Example: GIFs are a great example of video-only content. They aren’t accessible for a variety of reasons. However, if GIF creators wanted to meet this guideline they would add a description to provide more information about what is in the video through alt text or a transcription.

**[Guideline 1.2.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?currentsidebar=%23col_overview&showtechniques=222#captions-prerecorded)**: Caption should be provided for any pre-recorded videos with audio.
> Example: Netflix is an example that meets this requirement.

**[Guideline 1.2.3](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?currentsidebar=%23col_overview&showtechniques=222#audio-description-or-media-alternative-prerecorded)**: Any pre-recorded video with audio should have an alternative audio description.
> Example: Netflix is also an example that meets this requirement. They have started to include descriptions of physical interactions done by the actors through captions.

**[Guideline 1.4.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?currentsidebar=%23col_overview&showtechniques=222#audio-control)**: Any audio that automatically plays has the option to pause or stop.
> Example: Myspace is a good example of this. When going to a profile on Myspace, the audio will automatically play. The user can go to where the music is listed and have the option to pause the music.

**[Guideline 2.2.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?currentsidebar=%23col_overview&showtechniques=222#pause-stop-hide)**: The user should have the ability to pause, stop, or hide any moving, blinking, scrolling, or auto-updating content.
> Example: A good example of this is stock market websites. They tend to automatically update with the new stock information. There is typically an option for the user to pause the automatically updating information.

## Intermediate
**[Guideline 1.2.4](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?currentsidebar=%23col_overview&showtechniques=222#captions-live)**: Captions should be provided for any live videos with audio.
> Example: Facebook Live is a pretty good example of this. They have started to implement live captions.

**[Guideline 1.2.5](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?currentsidebar=%23col_overview&showtechniques=222#audio-description-prerecorded)**:  Any pre-recorded videos should have an audio description.
> Example: This would be implemented by having a voiceover describer that audibly voices the actions of the scenery, actions, and prompts of the video.

## Advanced
**[Guideline 1.2.6](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?currentsidebar=%23col_overview&showtechniques=222#sign-language-prerecorded)**: Any pre-recorded audio content should have sign language interpretation available.
> Example: A good example of this is accessible conferences, such as Tapia, tend to record their plenary talks where a sign language interpreter can easily be seen.

**[Guideline 1.2.7](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?currentsidebar=%23col_overview&showtechniques=222#extended-audio-description-prerecorded)**: Any pre-recorded videos should have extended audio descriptions.
> Example: This can be done by letting a video play until a good stopping point, pausing the video to give a detailed auditory description of what happened, and then continuing the video.

**[Guideline 1.2.8](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?currentsidebar=%23col_overview&showtechniques=222#media-alternative-prerecorded)**: Any pre-recorded video only media should have an alternative.
> Example: The alternative should be a text description through something like a transcript. It should be very detailed.

**[Guideline 1.2.9](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?currentsidebar=%23col_overview&showtechniques=222#audio-only-live)**: Any live audio only media should have an alternative that gives equivalent information.
> Example: An example found directly on the WCAG website is as follows: “A CEO is to give a press release by telephone to the media in response to a breaking news story, the audio is being recorded and streamed over the internet, but due to time constraints a Web captioning service cannot be set up in time. As the press release is a set statement which the CEO will be reading out, the company simultaneously provides the transcript of the release.”

**[Guideline 1.4.7](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?currentsidebar=%23col_overview&showtechniques=222#low-or-no-background-audio)**: Any pre-recorded audio only content should have either no background noise, the ability to turn off background noise, or background noise of at least 20 decibels lower than the foreground noise.
> Example: This is pretty self-explanatory and does not need an example listed.
