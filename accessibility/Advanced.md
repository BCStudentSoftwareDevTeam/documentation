# Advanced Checklist
The following guidelines are the WCAG 2.1 advanced guidelines - excluding the audio and video guidelines which you can find [here](http://172.31.2.178/en/accessibility/Audio&Video).

**[Guideline 1.3.6](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?currentsidebar=%23col_overview&showtechniques=222#identify-purpose)**: The purpose of User Interface Components, icons, and regions can be programmatically determined.
> Example: This example is provided by Deque University and is as follows: A user with a cognitive disability after a concussion has difficulty focusing and processing words. Their assistive technology is able to use the metadata provided with a webpage so that they can turn off the page sections other than the form they are focusing on, and replace some of the form labels with icons that they recognize and process more easily than words.

**[Guideline 1.4.6](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?currentsidebar=%23col_overview&showtechniques=222#contrast-enhanced)**: The contrast ratio of text and images of text should be set to at least 7.1 except for logos.
> Example:

**[Guideline 1.4.8](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?currentsidebar=%23col_overview&showtechniques=222#visual-presentation)**: The web page should give users the option to change the presentation through color, width, line spacing, and text size.
> Example:

**[Guideline 1.4.9](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?currentsidebar=%23col_overview&showtechniques=222#images-of-text-no-exception)**: Images of text should only be used for decoration or to convey information.
> Example:

**[Guideline 2.1.3](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?currentsidebar=%23col_overview&showtechniques=222#keyboard-no-exception)**: All functionality on the web page should be accessible through the keyboard without exceptions.
> Example:

**[Guideline 2.2.3](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?currentsidebar=%23col_overview&showtechniques=222#no-timing)**: There should not be any time limits on the web page.
> Example:

**[Guideline 2.2.4](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?currentsidebar=%23col_overview&showtechniques=222#interruptions)**: The user should have the option to postpone or suppress interruptions, except in cases of emergency.

**[Guideline 2.2.5](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?currentsidebar=%23col_overview&showtechniques=222#re-authenticating)**: All data should be saved when the authentication session expires. 
> Example:

**[Guideline 2.2.6](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?currentsidebar=%23col_overview&showtechniques=222#timeouts)**: The user should be warned of any timeout that will result in the loss of data. This does not apply to situations in which there is no user interaction for at least twenty hours.
> Example: A user with cognitive disabilities starts to fill out a hotel registration and soon becomes overwhelmed. The user should be able to come back to the hotel registration form within the twenty hour limit and start from where they left off or the user should be warned when the time limit for data is about to be lost.

> Example: [Here](https://davideperozzi.com/) is a website that uses parallax scrolling. It does **not** meet this guideline requirement as there is no way to stop the motions.

**[Guideline 2.4.8](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?currentsidebar=%23col_overview&showtechniques=222#location)**: It should be clear to the user where they are located.
