# Software Requests
This page houses requests for software that have not yet begun. Consider this our TODO list of new applications.

## CELTS

CELTS has inconsistent processes for gathering, storing, and reporting data related to service learning at Berea. They are requesting an application to help them manage data. 

Status (07/20/2020): Currently they are in a lean green belt project to solve the process problem. They are developing the future state in collaboration with Scott Heggen, Brian Ramsay, and Alex Bryant. Student Audrey Craft will be completing this Green belt in Spring 2021 and working on the design/software as her labor position for the 2020-2021 AY. 

## Office of Strategic Initiatives

Scott has promised to give OSI priority for the next project. Details about the project have not been discussed.

Status (07/20/2020): Pre-planning. 

## Continuous Improvement

Heather Schill (CI manager) would like an application to help manage the CI projects. Primarily she is interested in a tool for helping her report the results. Currently, an overloaded Excel sheet manages this data. 

Status (07/20/2020): Pre-planning.
