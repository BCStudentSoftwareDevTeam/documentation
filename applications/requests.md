# Software Requests
This page houses requests for software that have not yet begun. Consider this our TODO list of new applications.

## CELTS

Summary: CELTS has inconsistent processes for gathering, storing, and reporting data related to service learning at Berea. They are requesting an application to help them manage data. 

Contacts: Ashley Cochrane, Sarah Rorrer, Sheila Lyons

Status (07/20/2020): Currently they are in a lean green belt project to solve the process problem. They are developing the future state in collaboration with Scott Heggen, Brian Ramsay, and Alex Bryant. Student Audrey Craft will be completing this Green belt in Spring 2021 and working on the design/software as her labor position for the 2020-2021 AY. 

## Office of Strategic Initiatives

Summary: Scott has promised to give OSI priority for the next project. Details about the project have not been discussed.

Contacts: Teri Thompson

Status (07/20/2020): Pre-planning. 

## Continuous Improvement

Summary: The CI would like an application to help manage the CI projects. Primarily she is interested in a tool for helping her report the results. Currently, an overloaded Excel sheet manages this data. 

Contacts: Heather Schill

Status (07/20/2020): Pre-planning.

## EC Nominating Subcommittee

Summary: From email: "As a new member of EC and its Nominating Subcommittee, I've been floored by how complicated it is to come up with good ballots for all of the different council, committee, faculty meeting team, etc. positions.  I usually enjoy logic games, but I find this one not just challenging but frustrating because there are so many different variables, and many positions have their own sets of criteria: 1. College faculty or General faculty; 2. tenured, tenure-track, or continuing non-tenurable; 3. Division I, II, III, IV, V, or VI; 4. going on sabbatical next year, the year after, etc.; 5. already serving on other councils or committees; 6. number of years at Berea (to try to achieve well-matched ballots); 7. preference survey results; 8. male, female, or non-binary; 9. white, African-American, Latinx, Asian, multiracial, etc."

In addition, the Faculty Annual Reports (FAR) could be a related/connected application that Scott wants to build anyways.
