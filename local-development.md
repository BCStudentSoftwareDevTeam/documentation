It can be simpler and faster to develop locally on your computer rather than on a remote server. While you will eventually need to test in a production-like environment, you won't always have to be connected to the VPN or deal with SSH disconnects and delay.

## Linux & Mac OS
On a linux machine, you will need to install the necessary dependencies with `apt` or other package manager, and then everything should be the same as the linux VMs.

Mac OS is Unix based, so the applications have a pretty good chance of working without modification, once you get all of the dependencies installed.

#### Clone the application repository

#### Install Homebrew

#### Install Dependencies

#### Configure Dependencies

**Set default python**
**Set MySQL root password**


## Windows
You're on your own.
