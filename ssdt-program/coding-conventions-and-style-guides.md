# JavaScript Style Guide 

**Below is a summary of coding conventions and style guides discussed in the [W3 School Style Guide](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_conventions.asp) and [JavaScript Code Convention and Best Practices](https://coursework.vschool.io/javascript-code-conventions/) articles. Make sure to read those two articles, and come back to them when you have questions.**


### JavaScript Style Guide Summary

1. Write variable and function names in camelCase. 
1. All names have to start with a letter. 
1. Always put spaces around operators and after commas.
1. Indent code blocks by 2 spaces. 
1. Put the opening bracket of a function at the end of the first line and use one space before the opening bracket.
1. Put the closing bracket of a function on a new line.
1. Use colon and one space (newline) between each property and the value of an object. If an object is short, the properties and values can be written in one line. 
1. For the sake of readability, avoid lines longer than 80 characteres.

**Naming Conventions:**

1. Global variable and constants are written in UPPERCASE
```
MAX_VALUE = “1000”
```
2. Number - name it based on the value it represents
```
var age = 10;
```
3. String - same as above 
```
var location = "Salt Lake City";
```
4. Boolean - asks a yes/no question 
```
var isTheRealSlimShady = true;
```
5. Function - verb or action word/phrase describing its job
```
var capitalizeLetters = function (letter) {return letter.toUppercase()};
```
6. Array - Plural word describing its contents 
```
var instruments = ["guitar", "drums", "bass", "keyboard"];
```
7. Object - Singular word describing what it represents
```
var animal = {type: "cow"})
```

# Python Style Guide 
**PEP 8 is a style guide for Python code. We follow the PEP 8 guidelines to write more readable code.** 

**Make sure to read [PEP 8: The Style Guide for Python Code](https://pep8.org/) before coding.**
